                Kenbunshoku Haki is a form of Haki that allows the user to sense
                the presence of others, even if they are hidden or too far away
                to be seen naturally. If trained enough, the user can see a
                little bit into the future.<br />There are three categories:
                <strong>Basic:</strong> The most common use of this Haki allows
                the user to sense the presence of others.
                <strong>Intermediate:</strong> The user can also use this Haki
                to predict an opponent's moves just before making them.
                <strong>Advanced:</strong> Predict future movements whether
                there are murderous intentions in the environment or not. The
                user can see a little bit into the future.

              <h2 class="subtittle">Haoshoku Haki</h2>
              <p class="home-text">
                Haoshoku Haki is a rare form of Haki, only one in several
                million people has this ability. This type of Haki allows the
                user to exert their willpower on others. It is said that whoever
                possesses this type of Haki has the qualities of a king.
                <br />There are three categories: <strong>Basic:</strong> The
                most common usage is to exert the user's willpower on those with
                weak desires and render them unconscious.
                <strong>Intermediate:</strong> The user can pick weak-willed
                individuals out of a large group and eliminate them without
                affect others <strong>Advanced:</strong>: The users are capable
                of damaging inanimate objects or structures around them and
                users are able to infuse the body and weapons with the spirit of
                the conqueror in a very similar way to Busoshoku Haki , greatly
                increasing the power of attacks.

              <h2 class="subtittle">Busoshoku Haki</h2>
              <p class="home-text">
                Busoshoku Haki is a form of Haki that allows the user to use
                their spirit to create, in essence, invisible armor around
                themselves, providing potentially incredible offensive and
                defensive capabilities. Notably, this form of Haki can be used
                to injure Devil Fruit users who are immune to certain types of
                physical damage, most notably Logia users. <br />There are three
                categories: <strong>Basic:</strong> Grants a power and
                resistance enhancement. It can be used on a single body part or
                on the user's entire body. <strong>Intermediate:</strong> A
                strong concentration of this Haki can harden the user's body,
                turning the user's body a shiny black. The strengthening effect
                of this technique is able to easily block sword attacks and even
                break them. By touching an object, the user can imbue it with
                their own Haki to greatly increase their power and endurance.
                <strong>Advanced:</strong> The user can project their Haki flow
                a short distance from their body without a medium. This method
                allows the user to damage the target without making contact, but
                they still need to remain relatively close.
